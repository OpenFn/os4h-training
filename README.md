# OS4H Training Repository

Created for the OS4H team to save copies of OpenFn jobs prototyped as part of their OpenFn implementation training and practice. 

*Note that commits to `main` will be auto-deployed to OpenFn.org. Always work on a branch, and submit a PR to merge to `main`!*

## Getting started with the Repo

1. create `/tmp` folder locally with a `state.json` file that you don't commit to github
2. start writing and testing jobs locally with the relevant adaptor
